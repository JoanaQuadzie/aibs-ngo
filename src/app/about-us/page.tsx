          At WiTEN, we're concerned with addressing gender imbalance as many
          women face challenges like limited access to mentorship, educational
          resources or opportunities. Also, we seek to promote economic
          empowerment by fostering entrepreneurial skills and tech expertise
          such that our platform can drive economic empowerment, encouraging
          women to start tgeir own businesses or advance in their careers

          Our story began with a simple realization: despite the growing tech
          industry, women remain significantly underrepresented. Inspired by
          personal experiences in the field and the challenges faced by women
          entering tech, Joana Quadzie envisioned a platform where women could
          connect, learn, and grow together. Over time, this vision evolved into
          Women in Tech Empowerment Network WiTENâ€”a global initiative dedicated
          to breaking down barriers and building a more inclusive tech industry.
          We started with small workshops and one-on-one mentorship programs,
          and have since grown into a community that reaches across borders,
          providing women with the skills, support, and confidence to achieve
          their goals. The foundation of this journey is the belief that when
          women succeed, entire communities thrive, and by investing in women's
          futures, we are shaping a better world for everyone.
