## Project Description
Our project, Women in Tech Empowerment Network (WiTEN), is focused on empowering women by providing them with the skills, resources, and mentorship needed to thrive in the tech industry. Through targeted initiatives such as tech bootcamps, mentorship programs, entrepreneurship accelerators, and hackathons, we aim to bridge the gender gap and support women in breaking into tech. We also run outreach campaigns like digital literacy programs and STEM education for girls, fostering inclusivity and diversity. Ultimately, our goal is to equip women with the tools to lead, innovate, and create meaningful change in the tech world.
